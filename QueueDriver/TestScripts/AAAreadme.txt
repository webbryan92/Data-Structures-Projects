Each of these files contains a test script for
one of the Queue operations. There is also a test
script for Input-Output operations in the
command interpreter.

Use file redirection to run these test scripts
on a Queue command interpreter.

You can use Windows Batch Scripting to write a batch script that will
run all these test script files on your Queue command interpreter
with just one command.

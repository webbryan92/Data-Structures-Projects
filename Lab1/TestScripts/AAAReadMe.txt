This folder contains 4 sample test scripts.

2 test scripts test the doAddRightFront operation from List's command interpreter
2 test scripts test the doAdvance operation from List's command interpreter

These test scripts also make use of the doRightLength operation
from List's command interpreter. Therefore, doRightLength will need 
to be working correctly when using these test scripts.
